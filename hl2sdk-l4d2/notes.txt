This version of the Source SDK is meant only for compiling server plugins for
the engine that runs Valve's Left 4 Dead 2 game. An official SDK is not yet
available.

This is a modified version of the Orange Box SDK. Changes to it were reverse
engineered from the Left 4 Dead 2 engine and game binaries.
